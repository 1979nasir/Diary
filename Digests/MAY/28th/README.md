Leveraging blockchain technology, United Fans offers football fans the ability to purchase game tickets and merchandise, raise capital for their favorite teams, vote on club issues & even reward a player after a great game.


### What Are We Going To Solve?

On the one hand, football fans do not have a platform through which they can be involved in decision making, support or ownership of their team. The frustration among fans many times leads to riots & violence.
On the other hand, a lot of football clubs fail to meet their annual budget obligations and feel like their professional and financial efforts are not being appreciated.

### The Solution


What if we can help out both, fans and team managements, by allowing fans to vote on issues while raising money for those causes? Football fans will be able to decide on issues such as a player transfer or a coach recruitment, while backing that decision financially.

Team managements will be able to improve decision making, using crowd wisdom.

We believe that transparency in decision making will lead to enhanced crowd support and rising number of fans. The teams who will embrace the technology will improve the dialog between fans and team managements, as well as enhance the results of their teams and increase profits.

# [ICO] ORS GROUP / CONNECTING A.I. & BLOCKCHAIN.

![](https://i.imgur.com/calhIjg.jpg)

###WHO IS ORS?

The ORS Group is a software company of more than 100 IT developers and scientists. It boasts over 20 years of experience in delivering sophisticated A.I.-based optimization software solutions to a large international client base (www.ors.ai).
 
Their new product, the Hypersmart Contracts provide access to more than 1,000 proprietary algorithms and hundreds of software solutions to the Crypto Community and to established businesses (www.orsgroup.io).
 
At ORS, we envision a global network of entrepreneurs and independent companies empowered by our ABC technology building blocks: Algorithms, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.


###VISION

We aim to empower 1 billion new (small) entrepreneurs by 2040 by enabling them to compete with big corporations through access to A.I. and Blockchain technology. We at ORS, can foresee a future, in which within a few decades, robots and A.I. will run almost all businesses and unless our children become scientists, there will not be enough jobs for a population of almost 10 billion people. Brilliant minds like Stephen Hawking are worried that the owners of the robotic plants will not want to share the productivity gains and therefore a dystopian scenario might occur: a few giant corporations and extremely wealthy individuals will dominate and control almost all assets. We don't want this for our children! We envision instead a planet with billions of small, and independent companies trading and working together, coordinated through what we call the ABC building blocks of technologies: Algorithms, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency. Billions of entrepreneurs mean billions of financially independent people, free in their liife and free in their mind. This network of people will create a completely new social contract, a much better one and with much less unhealthy concentration of money and power. That's why ORS has entered the crypto space.


###ORS INFO

ORS is an established company with a strong track record of delivering sophisticated software and A.I. solutions to demanding clients among the Fortune 2000 list. We have calculated that our software solutions save our clients over $1 billion on a yearly basis. For more information on our history and existing products please visit our website.
We have already sold our the very first Hypersmart Contract to our partners at Eidoo. The Crypto-Robo-Advisor (video) is an A.I.-based Hypersmart Contract that takes into account every users‚Äô investment preferences and risk profiles and on the basis of that makes portfolio rebalancing and diversification recommendations. Please check out what are partners said about the (agreement).

We have successfully closed a pre-ICO round of EUR 10 million.

###MARKET

We are making our A.I. and software optimization tools available to the global community through blockchain

###BUSINESS MODEL

Any value chain is basically composed of three major flows: (i) the flow of goods/services; (ii) the flow of information; (iii) the flow of payments. ORS, thanks to its proprietary algorithms, is already able to ‚Äúextract‚Äù extremely high efficiency‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconditioned upon data availability‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom the processes related to the movement of goods/services within a value chain, by synchronizing the activities of all the participants, even independent ones. However, the flows of information, documents and payments are still very slow, cumbersome, and somehow stuck in the past. With the introduction of blockchain technology we were able to share information in a trusted environment with smart contracts executing transactions without intermediaries. So, the concept of Hypersmart Contracts was born.
 
Our Hypersmart Contracts are intelligent connectors, which activate A.I. algorithms (off-chain) to solve complex efficiency/optimization problems utilizing data stored on-chain by independent, decentralized organizations; and they can also release instant crypto payments. We are thus making all our algorithms and solutions available to the community at large ‚Äì providing the ABC technology building blocks: Algorithms, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency to entrepreneurs(explainer video).
