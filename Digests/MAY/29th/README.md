## OPEN | Technical Update, Kucoin listing and Blockchain Announcement



Hi there, the OPEN team is incredibly proud to announce a few major turning points in our project!

The first one is the announcement of our own blockchain... OPEN Chain. As a high-level overview, the OPEN Chain is a high throughput blockchain with an interoperable data transfer protocol. For blockchains to achieve mainstream adoption, developers need a way to integrate blockchain technologies within their existing technology stack in a fashion that doesn’t require them to sacrifice the throughput they receive with current centralized solutions.

### More Info

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OPEN CHAIN

OPEN Chain works with OPEN Platform to create a complete A — Z offering to create the most attractive blockchain ecosystem designed so far.

OPEN Platform has been rated the top 1–2 project by numerous research teams and has been backed by incredible visionaries from NEO, Draper Dragon, Jeremy Gardner, to Danhua Capital/DHVC. Now the OPEN team is launching OPEN Chain — an incredibly high throughput blockchain combined with our Scaffold technology to produce the most interoperable blockchain to date.

OPEN Platform: Middleware data and payments — Scaffold — Deploy your application to Ethereum (and soon to any blockchain) in under 10 minutes. This is already live and delivered by the OPEN team ahead of schedule!

OPEN Chain — Interoperability and Multi Consensus Balancing Protocol — Push data to any blockchain through one application build and process transactions at limitless TPS times.

*OPEN is being backed by the same backers of Zilliqa, Ontology, and VeChain.

These backers see the same potential behind OPEN’s vision and capability as a team as they did with those projects. We are proud to have them as our strongest backers in achieving OPEN’s success.*

Technical Details

Our team has heavily researched the development of the OPEN Chain, examining the most common blockchains and their technologies. We researched Node.JS as a tool which blockchains like Lisk are built on, C/C++ for Stellar, GoLang for OmiseGo, Kyber, Sia, Mixin, and JVM for Corda, Aion, R-Chain, and TRON.

OPEN has decided to utilize Kotlin for its blockchain development for numerous architectural reasons over Java, the next best option. Comparatively, Kotlin provides OPEN with better memory management, cross-platform capabilities, multi-threading support, is open-source, has well documented libraries and is supported by the community, as well as by Google.

With some blockchain networks that use a Proof-of-Work consensus, each member of the network is considered equivalent and all communication occurs exclusively between equivalent members of the network. This means that each node must be publicly available even when it is located behind a NAT or when the traffic is filtered by an ISP. This is the reason why blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum use UDP for communication between nodes: it not only allows the ability to find other nodes nearby, but also to bypass NAT and firewalls. In blockchain networks with a different consensus mechanism, the UDP communication layer is not required. In Blockchain networks with DPoS based consensus, unlike Blockchains with PoW Consensus, there are Delegate Nodes, sometimes referred to as Witnesses. These nodes perform the functions of delegated formation and verification of blocks. OPEN will utilize TCP as the primary communication layer. In summary, OPEN Chain is constructed using Kotlin over the TCP communication layer.

OPEN has been expanding its engineering team internationally in both Europe and in Asia to beat the proposed timeline

Key Details — Token Swap
OPEN Tokens will be swapped with the protocol blockchain token as OPEN Chain will be having no independent token sale. A bonus swap will occur to those who have not moved their OPEN Token out of their wallets after a certain date. These details will be announced shortly.

OPEN’s Chain is already under development and the team is rapidly expanding with offices globally to build out this initiative. We understand sharding is a strong theme right now, and OPEN’s load balancing protocol is the most effective transaction sharding implementation, coupled with data transaction interoperability to create the most exciting blockchain project undertaking yet! Zilliqa (ZIL), a project we respect, also addresses the sharding theme, but in an entirely different way in which Zilliqa shards have to communicate with each other constantly, which may neutralize the speed advantages of sharding. OPEN’s sharding is more of a load balancing approach, reflecting the architectural thinking that allowed distributed networks to thrive in the centralized world, which navigates around the need for shards to talk to each other and encompasses the ability to access and deploy to multiple blockchains. A trend we see taking place in the future of the industry and direction we have already delivered on in regards to our published Scaffolds.

Masternode programs will be accessible to those of the swap holding OPEN Token.
