#### Why Electroneum Classic:
Electroneum Classic takes Electroneum v2.0.0.0, which is pre-hardfork back to ASICS, and improves it.  
We added Zawy LWMA difficulty algo to prevent hashrate fluctuations and make 51% attacks much harder. 
We are sticking to CryptonightV7, with a custom variant of cryptonight a future possibility if new threats arise.

Instead of a hardfork we decided to restart the blockchain from genesis. 
This is because Electroneum had a 60% premine of 12.6 Billion coins, with a total supply of 21 Billion. 
This is clear dishonesty and there is about ~7 billion unaccounted coins (mined to an untraceable wallet in block 1) from what was stated in their ICO.
The current circulating supply is not 7,309,891,787 ETN as coinmarketcap states but it is ~14.9 billion
