### [ANN] ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Exereum 1:1 Ethereum based fork ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ 

### Exereum
#### High-speed Ethereum based blockchain


### Fork schedule

We decided to implement multisnap conception.

It means that we divide our fork to 10 steps.

The first snapshot occurs today 4 July at 15:00 UTC.

1 snapshot 04 July 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

2 snapshot 11 July 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

3 snapshot 18 July 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

4 snapshot 25 July 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

5 snapshot 01 August 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

6 snapshot 08 August 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

7 snapshot 15 August 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

8 snapshot 22 August 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

9 snapshot 29 August 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

10 snapshot 05 September 15:00 UTC - 10% snapshot

You will get 0,1 EXM for 1 ETH on your balance every snapshot step.
You will get 1 EXM for 1 ETH in the end.


### Reward program

Update for airdrop program

We announced series of airdrops to the most interesting projects based on Ethereum blockchain. We heard many questions about our selection criteries.

So, everybody who has blockchain based project on Ethereum may send us info.

Airdrop fund is now open for every good project!

We are starting our rewarding campaign for ERC-20 project's communities. We selected 2 candidates for our rewarding airdrop.

1. IDEX project
2. 
IDEX is decentralized exchange service for ERC-20 ecosystem provided by Aurora DAO.

1.000.000 EXM airdrop. For every IDX on your balance you'll get 500 EXM reward.

2. SONM project
3. 
Sonm is decentralized fog computing service. Tomorrow it launching mainnet. 

7.200.000 EXM airdrop. For every SNM on your balance you'll get ~0.05 EXM

It's only start...


### THE PROJECT FEATURES:

1. Fair distribution
No ICO: this is a fully non-commercial project with a technological research aim.
The initial emission will be partly distributed via a fork among the Ethereum holders. A reserved share will be gradually distributed among the ERC-20 tokens holders.

2. Capacity
The fork is using a 2-level network architecture:
Masternodes are responsible for transactions verification.
POW nodes are responsible for adding blocks and synchronisation.
Moreover, there is a possibility of using the turing-full smart-contracts.

3. The emission
50% of tokens emission is distributed between the masternode holders providing a high speed of transactions processing. The rest 50% of emission is distributed between the POW nodes according to the hashrate proportion.
 
4. Active cooperation
The team is negotiating with the decentralised services and applications developers to launch it based on our network.
A part of reserved Exereum coins will be gradually distributed over the years between the token holders of these services to grow the network value.

5. Exchanges
The Exereum team is currently negotiating with the exchanges about the users deposit snapshot and a further Exereum listing.

6. Anonymous
We are going to integrate the ZK-snarks certificates powered by ZCash team in our network (look roadmap)
