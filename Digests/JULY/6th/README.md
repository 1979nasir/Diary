Gravium (GRV) is a cryptocurrency backed by the security of the latest in ASIC resistant mining algorithm. A community driven project that has been engineered specifically for implementation into the everyday business and personal transactions. With low transaction fees and 1-minute block times, you will have your funds available anywhere and anytime.



GRV is aimed at becoming a mainstay cryptocurrency, used worldwide with a great reward system for people supporting the GRV network. While other cryptocurrencies are looking to large scale companies to incorporate their coin, for a large company or organisation this is not a feasible option as they would need to instantly convert the cryptocurrency back to FIAT to capitalize on the current conversion rate.

For example, if an organization has a 15% mark up on a product they have sold and the price of the traded cryptocurrency drops 20%, the company has lost 5% on their cost price. It would cost a large company more money than it is worth it to be able to incorporate this scale. On the other hand, a small company or a company that provides services, rather than product, would be able to handle this trade back to FIAT without the worry of loosing large sums of money.



In the first instance, GRV will be rolled out across a familiar DASH wallet platform, with plans to move to Electrum in the near future. With the growing community of GRV, we will be able to incorporate GRV across multiple wallet platforms currently active in the market place, or if necessary develop an easy to use application to bring Gravium to the masses.
