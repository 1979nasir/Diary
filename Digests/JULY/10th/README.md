### Digital currency for the real world â€“ the fast and free way to pay for everything in life.

#### Instant transactions   -   Zero fees   -   Infinitely scalable

Nano, formerly RaiBlocks (XRB), using its own block-lattice structure, wants to succeed where Bitcoin has fallen short. It promises to deliver zero-fee transactions in real time without the same work-intensive overhead and energy consumption as Bitcoin. Like IOTA, Nano uses a Directed acyclic graph (DAG), but instead of using DAG for the tangle, Nano employs its own novel tech called the "block-lattice".

Nano's mission is to become a global currency with instantaneous transactions and zero fees over a secure, decentralized network.
