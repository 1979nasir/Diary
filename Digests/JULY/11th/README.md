### [ANN][ICO AUG 8] X-INFINITY Merchant-Enabled Unified Cryptocurrency Wallet 


X-Infinity, a Singapore based fintech company, is creating a unified cryptocurrency wallet that allows consumers and merchants the ability to transact as easily using any blockchain asset as a currency. X-Infinity features a debit card that acts as a proxy to the wallet.

#### Problem


With the growing emergence of different cryptocurrency assets, a growing number of users and businesses struggle to use existing infrastructures to interconnect physical and virtual platforms. A number of issues are slowing mass adoption:
 
- Increase in the number of cryptocurrencies makes it harder for merchants to accept a broad range effectively.
- Volatility of cryptocurrency prices make it harder for merchants to adopt them.
- No major market for some cryptocurrencies making transacting difficult.
- No single wallet for all cryptocurrencies, so some are not easily usable.


#### Solution

Unified Cryptocurrency Wallet Transactions

X-Infinity plans to use Cross-chain Payment Channels and the Blockchain Routing Protocol to allow users to use their blockchain assets in real-time in the real world. It leverages the power of the smartphone and blockchain to deliver a compelling, secure and scalable consumer experience.

X-Infinity can aggregate a user’s blockchain assets through a single wallet. This provide customers with the ability to link their assets to a payment card (debit card – physical, or phone app - virtual). This ensures that X-Infinity is the first choice wallet for users.

The phone is used as a controller. Offering complete flexibility, the app dashboard controls which bank card is active and when, rules for spending etc.



The X-Infinity App is available for Android and iOS!
