### [ANN][ICO AUG 8] X-INFINITY Merchant-Enabled Unified Cryptocurrency Wallet 


X-Infinity, a Singapore based fintech company, is creating a unified cryptocurrency wallet that allows consumers and merchants the ability to transact as easily using any blockchain asset as a currency. X-Infinity features a debit card that acts as a proxy to the wallet.

#### Problem


With the growing emergence of different cryptocurrency assets, a growing number of users and businesses struggle to use existing infrastructures to interconnect physical and virtual platforms. A number of issues are slowing mass adoption:
 
- Increase in the number of cryptocurrencies makes it harder for merchants to accept a broad range effectively.
- Volatility of cryptocurrency prices make it harder for merchants to adopt them.
- No major market for some cryptocurrencies making transacting difficult.
- No single wallet for all cryptocurrencies, so some are not easily usable.
